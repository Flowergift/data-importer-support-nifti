# Technical Demonstration: Data Import from CSV and JSON Files

## Overview
This solution demonstrates the implementation of data import from CSV and JSON files into in-memory data structures. It follows best practices for software design, coding, testing, and documentation.

## Key Functionality
- Imports data from CSV and JSON files using libraries like FileHelpers and Newtonsoft.Json
- Applies design patterns and principles (SOLID, etc.) to ensure code quality and maintainability
- Provides comprehensive unit tests covering positive and negative scenarios
- Adheres to clean, well-formatted, and well-named C# code
- Includes documentation on the architecture, design decisions, and potential improvements

## Installation and Usage
1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open the solution in Visual Studio (2022 or later).
3. Build the solution to compile the code.
4. Run the TechnicalDemonstration project to execute the data import.

## Test Data
